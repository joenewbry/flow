# Tasks
- [x] Add start functionality that starts taking a screenshot every minute and saving it. This should be a tool called start-flow 
- [x] Add stop functionality that's a tool called stop-flow
- [x] Check to see if we'll still need to start chroma seperately to get this to work. Or if the MCP server handles that as well
- [x] Make a tool called get-stats that returns the number of OCR json files on disk and also the number of items in the chroma collection called screen_history or screenshots. I forget what I named it


# Guide
- Please make sure to commit each task item
- Please mark each task item as completed after you do it
- This work is very important so do the very best you can
- Goal is to be able to run everything from the MCP server so I can start and stop recording my Claude Desktop client instead of something in the command line. 
- Before you start please ask clarifying questions and make a plan so I can give you feedback.
