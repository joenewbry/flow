# âœ… Audio Recording System Setup Complete

## What Was Done

The audio recording system has been fully updated to integrate with Flow's existing infrastructure and use OpenAI's Whisper API for transcription.

## Key Changes

### 1. âœ… Audio Data Storage
- **Location**: `refinery/data/audio/` (confirmed)
- **Format**: `.md` files (markdown transcripts with timestamps)
- **Additional files**: `.json` (metadata) and `.wav` (audio backup)

### 2. âœ… OpenAI Whisper API Integration
- Switched from local Whisper model to OpenAI Whisper API
- Requires `OPENAI_API_KEY` in `.env` file
- Benefits:
  - No local model download required
  - Cloud-based processing
  - High accuracy
  - Cost: ~$0.006 per minute

### 3. âœ… Unified ChromaDB Collection
- Audio and OCR data now stored in the **same collection**: `screen_ocr_history`
- **Differentiation via tags**:
  - OCR data: `data_type: "ocr"`
  - Audio data: `data_type: "audio"`
- Allows unified search or filtered search by type

### 4. âœ… Chunk-Based Processing
The audio system uses a sophisticated chunk-based approach:
1. **Monitors** system audio continuously
2. **Detects** when audio activity starts (above silence threshold)
3. **Records** in 30-second chunks
4. **Transcribes** each chunk in real-time using OpenAI API
5. **Saves** to markdown with timestamps
6. **Indexes** in ChromaDB for searchability

### 5. âœ… Updated Documentation
- **README.md**: Added comprehensive audio section explaining setup and usage
- **AUDIO_BACKGROUND_README.md**: Updated with new API-based approach
- **audio_requirements.txt**: Updated dependencies (OpenAI SDK, python-dotenv)
- **start_audio_background.sh**: Updated startup script with new paths

## How to Use

### Initial Setup
```bash
# 1. Run audio setup
./setup_audio_recorder.sh

# 2. Add your OpenAI API key
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key-here" >> .env
```

### Starting the System
```bash
# Start ChromaDB (if not already running)
cd refinery && source .venv/bin/activate && chroma run --host localhost --port 8000

# In another terminal: Start audio recording
./start_audio_background.sh
```

### What Happens During Recording
When system audio is detected (Zoom call, meeting, etc.):
1. Recording starts automatically
2. Audio is captured in 30-second chunks
3. Each chunk is transcribed via OpenAI API
4. Transcripts are saved as markdown in `refinery/data/audio/`
5. Each transcript chunk is indexed in ChromaDB
6. You can search your audio transcripts just like OCR data

### Searching Audio Data

**Search everything (audio + OCR):**
```python
results = collection.query(
    query_texts=["project deadline"]
)
```

**Search only audio:**
```python
results = collection.query(
    query_texts=["meeting discussion"],
    where={"data_type": "audio"}
)
```

**Search only OCR:**
```python
results = collection.query(
    query_texts=["github repository"],
    where={"data_type": "ocr"}
)
```

## File Structure

```
refinery/data/
â”œâ”€â”€ ocr/                    # Screen OCR data (tagged: data_type="ocr")
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ *.json
â””â”€â”€ audio/                  # Audio transcripts (tagged: data_type="audio")
    â”œâ”€â”€ auto_*.md          # Markdown transcripts
    â”œâ”€â”€ auto_*.json        # Session metadata
    â””â”€â”€ auto_*.wav         # Audio recordings (backup)
```

## Example Markdown Transcript

```markdown
# Audio Transcript: auto_20241015_143022

**Session Start:** 2024-10-15T14:30:22

## [14:30:25]

Welcome everyone to today's standup meeting. Let's go around and share what we worked on yesterday.

## [14:31:02]

I worked on the authentication system and fixed the bug with password resets...
```

## Verification

To verify everything is working:

1. **Check audio directory exists**: `ls -la refinery/data/audio/`
2. **Start audio recording**: `./start_audio_background.sh`
3. **Play some audio** or join a Zoom call
4. **Check for .md files**: `ls -la refinery/data/audio/*.md`
5. **Query ChromaDB** to see audio data:
   ```python
   collection.query(where={"data_type": "audio"})
   ```

## Requirements

- âœ… Python 3.10+ with audio_env virtual environment
- âœ… OpenAI API key in `.env` file
- âœ… ffmpeg (for audio capture)
- âœ… ChromaDB running on localhost:8000
- âœ… System permissions for audio/screen recording

## Benefits

1. **Unified Search**: Find information across both what you saw (OCR) and what you heard (audio)
2. **Complete Context**: Get the full picture of meetings and work sessions
3. **Automatic**: No manual recording needed
4. **Searchable**: All audio is transcribed and indexed
5. **Flexible**: Filter by type or search across all data
6. **Markdown Storage**: Human-readable transcripts you can open in any editor

## Next Steps

1. Add audio recording to your daily workflow
2. Search across audio and OCR data to find anything you need
3. Build on this foundation (e.g., speaker diarization, real-time summaries)
