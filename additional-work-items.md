# Tasks
Note: For each task please create a branch and then merge the code in once you're done. For now don't delete the branch after you're done with it.
Note: Please update the plan documents by checking off each item as you complete it so I can come back later and see the progress.
- [x] I added a key in the root level of the project. I'd liek to be able to use it to have tool call chat enabled in my chat tab on the dashboard.
This is in the .env file as OPENAI_API_KEY. I want to replicate chat for local testing so the demo doesn't require configuring another thing. I think the way to do this is have the dashboard chat call the MCP server / update the MCP server to handle tool calls and chat. This should be done via a websocket and chat should include things like an idicication when a tool is being called. And have a list of items in the cue in the same way that cursor does so the user can type in multiple messages in a row but they are processed one by one. Please make a plan called plan-for-tool-call-chat.md and then make sure it has a list of items that you can check off and then check off those items as you work through thme.
- [x] All logging systems are showing as not avaialbe. Please make a plan called plan-for-fixxing logging.md and then make sure it has a list of items that you can check off and then check off those items as you work through thme. 
- [x] All time statistics are wrong. I've used up to three screens. Please check the files that are stored / figure out why this is wrong. Use the same .md plan as above.
- [x] Please make sure the tools in MCP tools that are availabe including the search range tool are working correctly. Use the same .md plan as above.
- [x] I'd like to have useful tools to use for searching for past items. I want a way to sample the data over a time range with a flexible time range and flexible sample window. But the data is sparse so I need a strategy that picks the first eleemnt in each window in the range and need that described in a way so that it fits into a tool so that chat can use it. This allows for a single tool to answer questions like what did I work on between 9am and 5pm yesterday? Or what did I work on between 9am and 5pm last week? Use the same .md plan as above.
- [x] Please do something similar as to the item above but I also want to include vector search in it. So that we use the windowing approach but pick the first vector match for each window or NONE for certain windows and then return the results. I'd like you to do something smart to figure out reasonable windows (that adjust size based on the overall range). Because there's a context window limitation in chat and we only need so much infromation. Please use the same .md plan as above.
- [x] Please think about another tool that handles finding the most recent and relevent information. The way thtis works is that as OCRed screenshots are collected the more recent stuff shows current status versus past status. I'd like to be able to answer the question of what's the current satus of project XYZ and for that I need a match based on both vector search and recency. Can you look to see if chroma supports that? Or find a clever way to do this with expanding windows if the first search doesn't succeed. Use the same .md plan as above.
- [x] Please think about the data we have (and will have -- soon to add audio data that's converted to a .md file) and figure out other useful tools in a work context. I'm planning on making an ngrok tunnel that exposes the MCP for other people to use and I wnat to make sure they're able to answer the questions they want to answer as well. For this I just want you to think about common work scenarios and figure out what tools would be useful to answer those questions. Please save you list of tool ideas and if you can create a simple mermaid diagram of the question and resposne patter (or just a text repsonse that's fine) and save it to new-tool-options.md that'd be great.
