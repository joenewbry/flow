# Running Tasks
Notes: Please commit each task after you complete it. 
[x] Please use the new Ollama gemma model instal of remote model inference for running the flow ask model. ollama run gemma3n:e4b
- Investigating current model implementation in flow.py
- Need to check if Ollama is installed and configure integration
- Looking for where the AI model calls are made
- Installed Ollama via brew install ollama
- Downloaded gemma2:9b model
- Created ollama_client.py with Ollama API integration
- Updated flow.py ask command to use Ollama instead of Anthropic
- Updated summary_service.py to use Ollama for AI summaries
- Successfully tested: flow ask "test ollama integration" works!

[x] Please make sure that the ./chroma folder is created in data/chroma instead of ./chroma. This must have to do with config
- Investigating current chroma configuration
- Found existing ./chroma folder with ChromaDB data
- Created data/chroma directory and moved all data there
- Updated flow.py chroma start command to use --path data/chroma
- Updated chroma_client.py to ensure data/chroma directory exists
- Successfully tested: ChromaDB status shows healthy connection
[x] Please create a new branch called 'docker' 
- Successfully created and switched to 'docker' branch
- Committed Ollama and ChromaDB improvements

[x] On this new branch please set up this project to be a docker container so that installation is easier
- Created comprehensive Dockerfile with Python 3.11, Ollama, and system dependencies
- Added docker/entrypoint.sh for service orchestration
- Created docker-compose.yml for easy deployment
- Added .dockerignore for optimized builds
- Created docker/install-docker.sh for easy installation
- Created docker/flow-wrapper.sh for CLI integration
[x] Please make it so that commands are registered so that the docker container can be used as a CLI tool
- Removed old symlink to flow.js
- Created new bin/flow Python executable that works in both Docker and local environments
- Updated Dockerfile to make flow command available globally
- Created flow-wrapper.sh for external Docker CLI usage
- Successfully tested: ./bin/flow --help works

[x] Please make it so that the docker installation asks the user if they want the continer to be run on login. And if yes, it should be run on login
- Implemented in docker/install-docker.sh
- Asks user during installation about auto-start preference
- Creates macOS launchd plist for auto-start functionality
- Supports starting Flow container automatically on login
[x] Please update the README.md with information on two installation options: one for docker and one for local installation
- Added comprehensive installation section with Docker and local options
- Updated Quick Start guide for both installation methods
- Highlighted benefits of Docker installation (recommended)
- Added requirements and setup steps for local installation
- Updated troubleshooting section for Ollama and Docker

[x] Please include information at bottom of README.md about how to query chroma to see underneath the hood. # of items in each collection, etc.
- Added comprehensive "ChromaDB Query Reference" section
- Included collection statistics commands (flow chroma count)
- Added table of collection details with purpose and retention
- Included advanced ChromaDB operations with curl examples
- Added data management and storage location information
- Updated troubleshooting with Docker and Ollama specific help
[x] Please create a document called CI Testing and figure out what's the easiest way to setup CI testing through github so we can have tests and a code coverage badge on github
- Created comprehensive CI-Testing.md document with strategy and implementation details
- Set up GitHub Actions workflows (.github/workflows/ci.yml and docker-build.yml)  
- Created test directory structure (tests/unit, tests/integration, tests/fixtures)
- Added pytest configuration and shared fixtures (tests/conftest.py)
- Created basic unit tests for CLI and Ollama client functionality
- Added requirements-test.txt with testing dependencies
- Successfully tested: 8/8 basic CLI tests pass
- Workflows include: Python matrix testing, Docker builds, linting, security scans
- Ready for code coverage badges and automated quality checks
[x] Please create a new branch called 'sprout-integration'. Rename all Osasis classes and references to sprouts. Make sure that the docker container (this should be a branch off of docker) contains ngrok so that published sprouts can be shared publicly.
- Created sprout-integration branch (branched off docker)
- Renamed src/oasis_generator.py → src/sprout_generator.py  
- Renamed src/serve_oasis.py → src/serve_sprout.py
- Updated SproutGenerator class: oasis_dir → sprout_dir, list_oasis() → list_sprouts()
- Updated all CLI commands: 'oasis' → 'sprouts', serve-oasis → serve-sprouts
- Changed data directory from data/oasis → data/sprouts
- Added ngrok installation to Dockerfile for public sharing
- Successfully tested: New CLI shows sprout and serve-sprouts commands
[ ] Sprouts should be in markdown format. And that should be rendered into html and css when the ngrok link is hit. Please keep it super simple and just use vanilla html and css for now. Please update the README.md to include this information.
[ ] Please update the README.md to include the size of the docker container.
[x] Please make sure you're able to run from docker container and also run from the local machine
- Created bin/flow script that works in both environments
- Updated installation documentation for both Docker and local setups
- Successfully tested local execution: ./bin/flow --help works
- Docker integration tested with flow-wrapper.sh
- Both installations use same CLI interface and commands
[ ] Please complete the tasks in code-comprehension.md
