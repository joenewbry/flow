<h2>Why This Architecture Works</h2>
<h3>For Non-Technical Users</h3>
<p>Every decision and action is documented in plain English:<br />

<ul>
<li>Complete audit trail of all decisions</li>
<li>Pattern recognition from accumulated data</li>
<li>Easy to adjust strategies by editing markdown</li>

<li>Family members can review and contribute</li>
<li>Healthcare providers can see the approach</li>
<li>Clear explanation of every automated action</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Vision</h2>
<p>Imagine waking up knowing that:<br />
- Your brother already received his morning encouragement<br />
