        <h1>AI Support Processes: Long-Running Task Management</h1>
<p><em>Building on the <a href="https://b150dc5a8e25.ngrok-free.app/page/human-computer">Human Computer</a> concept for spawning and managing extended support tasks</em></p>
<h2>Core Concept: The Support Agent Process</h2>
<p>A long-running task is like hiring a dedicated assistant for a specific mission. You define the goal, provide the resources, set the parameters, and let it run‚Äîlearning and adapting over time.</p>
<h2>Example: Supporting Your Brother</h2>
<p>Let's walk through how this works with your specific use case:</p>
<h3>Task Definition</h3>
<pre><code class="language-markdown"># Task: Daily Brother Support Campaign

## Success Metrics
- Engagement rate &gt; 70%
- Positive response sentiment &gt; 60%
- Weekly activity completion &gt; 1
- Maintained family connection

## Resources
- Profile data about Scott

    J --&gt; K[Escalate to Human]
</code></pre>
<h3>1. Initialization Phase</h3>
<pre><code class="language-markdown"># process/brother-support/initialization.md

## Context Setup
- Load Scott's profile from `people/scott/profile.md`
- Import communication preferences
- Set up message channels (Email/WhatsApp)
- Initialize learning parameters
- Create baseline metrics

## Information Sources Connected
- ‚úì Email API for sending
- ‚úì Calendar for therapy schedule
- ‚úì Family shared folder for advice
- ‚úì Health data feed
- ‚úì Previous conversation history

## Strategy Selection
Based on profile, starting with:
- Approach: Warm, brotherly, humor-based
- Timing: 9 AM, 2 PM, 8 PM check-ins
- Content: 40% humor, 30% nature, 30% motivation

## Hypotheses to Test
1. Morning messages work better on weekends
2. Nature content increases engagement
3. Family mentions improve response rate
</code></pre>
<h3>2. Daily Execution Loop</h3>
<pre><code class="language-markdown"># process/brother-support/daily/2025-10-16.md

## Morning Routine (6:00 AM)
1. Check overnight messages
2. Review yesterday's learnings
3. Gather new inputs
4. Plan today's approach

## Input Ingestion (6:15 AM)
### New Information Available:
- Family advice: &quot;Dad suggests hiking this weekend&quot;
- Health data: Sleep quality 6/10
- Calendar: Therapy at 2 PM
- Weather: Sunny, 72¬∞F

### Context Integration:
- Good weather + Dad's advice = Outdoor activity opportunity
- Therapy day = Supportive, no pressure
- Sleep mediocre = Gentle morning approach

## Today's Plan
- 9:00 AM - Gentle good morning (no pressure)
- 11:30 AM - Pre-therapy encouragement
- 3:30 PM - Post-therapy space (no questions)
- 5:00 PM - Suggest weekend hike (Dad's idea)
- 8:00 PM - Wind-down check-in
</code></pre>
<h3>3. Information Ingestion</h3>
<p>The system continuously ingests information from multiple sources:</p>
<pre><code class="language-markdown"># process/inputs/sources.md

## Active Information Feeds

### 1. Markdown Documents (Manual)
**Location:** `inputs/healthcare/`
**Format:** Structured markdown
**Frequency:** After each appointment
**Example:**
</code></pre>
<h1>Therapist Notes - 2025-10-16</h1>
<h2>Key Themes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Working on catastrophizing thoughts</li>
<li>Sleep hygiene priority</li>
<li>Encourage outdoor activities</li>
</ul>
<h2>Suggested Interventions</h2>
<ul>
<li>Gentle reality testing</li>
<li>Evening routine reminders</li>
<li>Nature-based behavioral activation</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>
### 2. Family Input
**Location:** `inputs/family/`
**Format:** Informal notes
**Processing:** Extract actionable suggestions
</code></pre>
<p>Mom says: "Scott seemed happy after choir practice. <br />
Maybe mention music more?"<br />
‚Üí Action: Increase music-related content</p>
<pre><code>
### 3. Response Analytics
**Automatic Processing:**
- Response time (how quickly he replies)
- Message length (engagement level)
- Sentiment analysis (mood indicators)
- Keywords (interests, concerns)

### 4. External Data
- Weather (for outdoor suggestions)
- Calendar (respect boundaries)
- News/Events (relevant topics)
</code></pre>
<h3>4. Learning &amp; Adaptation</h3>
<pre><code class="language-markdown"># process/brother-support/learning/week-42.md

## Weekly Learning Summary

### What Worked ‚úÖ
- Afternoon messages (2-4 PM): 85% response rate
- Dad attribution: Positive reception
- Nature memes: Highest engagement
- Post-therapy space: Appreciated

### What Didn't Work ‚ùå
- Morning messages before 9 AM: Often ignored
- Multiple behavioral suggestions: Overwhelming
- Generic motivation quotes: No engagement

### Pattern Recognition
- Energy follows predictable daily curve
- Therapy days need lighter touch
- Weekend receptiveness 40% higher
- Humor breaks tension effectively

### Strategy Adjustments for Next Week
1. Shift 70% of messages to 2-4 PM window
2. Limit behavioral prompts to 1/day
3. Increase nature content to 50%
4. Add music references per Mom's observation

### New Hypotheses to Test
- &quot;Music mentions on choir days increase positivity&quot;
- &quot;Saturday morning is optimal for activity planning&quot;
- &quot;Shared family memories improve connection&quot;
</code></pre>
<h3>5. Decision Transparency</h3>
<p>Every decision is logged with reasoning:</p>
<pre><code class="language-markdown"># decisions/2025-10-16/14-30-meme-selection.md

## Decision Point: 2:30 PM Message

### Context
- Time: Post-therapy (ended at 2 PM)
- Last response: None (therapy)
- Mood indicator: Unknown (in therapy)
- Energy level: Assumed moderate

### Options Considered
1. **Skip message** - Give more space
   - Pro: Respect therapy processing
   - Con: Miss connection opportunity

2. **Send light meme** - Gentle touch
   - Pro: Non-intrusive, supportive
   - Con: Might seem dismissive

3. **Send &quot;thinking of you&quot;** - Direct support
   - Pro: Shows care
   - Con: Might feel pressured

### Decision: Option 2 (Light meme)
**Reasoning:** 
- History shows appreciation for post-therapy lightness
- Meme allows engagement without obligation
- Can gauge mood from response

### Execution
- Selected: Nature meme with calm vibe
- Message: &quot;thought you'd like this üå≤&quot;
- Sent: 2:31 PM

### Result
- Read: 2:33 PM ‚úì
- Response: &quot;nice, thanks&quot; (2:45 PM)
- Sentiment: Neutral-positive
- Learning: Approach validated

            'analyzer': SentimentAnalyzer(),
            'scheduler': TaskScheduler(),
            'learner': PatternLearner()
        }

    async def daily_execution(self):
        # Morning planning
        context = await self.gather_context()
        plan = await self.create_daily_plan(context)

        # Execute throughout day
        for scheduled_action in plan:
            await self.wait_until(scheduled_action.time)
            result = await self.execute_action(scheduled_action)
            await self.process_result(result)

        # Evening learning
        await self.reflect_and_learn()
</code></pre>
<h3>Handling Complex Scenarios</h3>

<h2>The Power of Transparent AI Processes</h2>
<p>Unlike traditional automation:<br />
- Every decision has a reason<br />
- Every action has a record<br />
- Every pattern leads to learning<br />
- Every stakeholder can understand</p>
<p>This isn't about replacing human care‚Äîit's about ensuring that care is consistent, thoughtful, and adaptive, even when life gets overwhelming.</p>
<p>The markdown foundation means that at any moment, you can ask "What is happening with my brother's support?" and get a complete, understandable answer‚Äînot a black box, but a glass box where every gear is visible and every decision is documented.</p>
<hr />
<p><em>Your support process is now ready to begin. The infrastructure is transparent, the learning is continuous, and the care is consistent. All that's needed is your intent and the system handles the execution.</em></p>
