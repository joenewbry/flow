# Test Markdown Page

This is a test page to demonstrate markdown rendering with beautiful styling inspired by BearBlog.

## Features

Here are some of the things you can do with markdown:

### Text Formatting

You can use **bold text**, *italic text*, and even `inline code`. Links look great too: [Flow Project](https://github.com/yourusername/flow).

### Code Blocks

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello from Flow!")
    return True
```

### Lists

Unordered lists:
- First item
- Second item
- Third item with a very long line that should wrap properly and look good when it does so

Ordered lists:
1. First step
2. Second step
3. Third step

### Blockquotes

> "The best way to predict the future is to invent it."
> <footer>— Alan Kay</footer>

## Horizontal Rules

Use `---` to create a horizontal rule like the one above.

## What's Next?

This markdown file is now being served dynamically by the Flow website builder. Any `.md` file in the `pages/` directory will be automatically rendered with this beautiful styling.
