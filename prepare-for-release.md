# Flow - Prepare for Hacker News Release

## Documentation Strategy

### Recommended Approach: Multi-Layered Documentation

1. **README.md** (Keep as entry point)
   - Quick project overview
   - Installation instructions
   - Basic usage
   - Link to detailed docs

2. **GitHub Wiki** (Comprehensive documentation)
   - Architecture deep-dives
   - Advanced usage guides
   - Troubleshooting
   - API documentation

3. **FAQ.md** (In repo root)
   - Common questions answered quickly
   - "Why Flow?" vs alternatives
   - Privacy concerns addressed
   - Performance expectations

4. **CONTRIBUTING.md** (Standard GitHub file)
   - How to contribute
   - Code style guide
   - PR process
   - Development setup

5. **docs/** directory (Alternative to wiki)
   - Can be GitHub Pages site
   - Better for version control
   - Easier to maintain with code
   - More discoverable

**Recommendation:** Use `docs/` directory + GitHub Pages instead of wiki. More maintainable, version-controlled, and professional.

## Emergency Responses

### "This is just like Rewind.ai"
> "Yes! Rewind.ai proved the value of screen memory. Flow is open-source, self-hosted, and free. You own your data completely."

### "Why would I want this?"
> "Ever forgot where you saw something? What was in that doc? What someone said in Slack? Flow remembers. Search your entire digital history in seconds."

### "Privacy concerns?"
> "100% local. No cloud. No tracking. You can inspect the code. Delete anytime. Your data never leaves your machine."

### "Performance impact?"
> "Minimal. ~50MB RAM. Screenshots every 60s (configurable). OCR runs in background. No noticeable impact."

### "Why not Rust?"
> "Python for rapid development, Tesseract for OCR, ChromaDB for vectors. Easy to contribute. Rust would be great for v2!"

## Remember

- **Be humble** - This is v1.0, it has rough edges
- **Be responsive** - Quick responses build community
- **Be grateful** - Thank every contribution
