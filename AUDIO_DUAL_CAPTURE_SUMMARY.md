# ‚úÖ Audio System Now Captures EVERYTHING!

## What Changed

The audio recording system has been updated to capture **ALL audio** on your computer:

### Before:
- ‚ùå Only system audio (Zoom, YouTube, etc.)
- ‚ùå No microphone capture

### After:
- ‚úÖ **Microphone** (your voice)
- ‚úÖ **System audio** (YouTube, Zoom, music, all sounds)
- ‚úÖ **Both mixed together** in one transcript

## How It Works

The system now uses **dual audio capture**:

1. **Microphone Input**: Captures what you say
2. **System Audio**: Captures everything playing on your computer
3. **Mixed Together**: Both sources are combined and transcribed as one stream

### Technical Implementation

- Uses **BlackHole** virtual audio device to route system audio
- **ffmpeg** captures both microphone and BlackHole simultaneously
- Audio streams are mixed using `amix` filter
- Transcribed as a single unified transcript

## What Gets Captured

Everything audio-related on your computer:

| Audio Source | Captured? | Example |
|--------------|-----------|---------|
| Your microphone | ‚úÖ | What you say in meetings |
| Zoom participants | ‚úÖ | What others say on calls |
| YouTube videos | ‚úÖ | Video audio content |
| Music/Spotify | ‚úÖ | Songs playing |
| System sounds | ‚úÖ | Notifications, alerts |
| Browser audio | ‚úÖ | Any web audio |
| App audio | ‚úÖ | Discord, Slack calls, etc. |

## Setup Required

To enable full dual capture, you need:

1. **BlackHole installed**: `brew install blackhole-2ch`
2. **Audio routing configured**: Multi-Output Device in Audio MIDI Setup
3. **System output set**: To the Multi-Output device

**See `AUDIO_SETUP_GUIDE.md` for step-by-step instructions.**

## Fallback Behavior

The system gracefully handles different configurations:

- **With BlackHole configured**: Captures microphone + system audio ‚úÖ
- **Without BlackHole**: Captures microphone only ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **No ffmpeg**: Shows error and installation instructions ‚ùå

## Example Transcript

Here's what a transcript looks like with dual capture:

```markdown
# Audio Transcript: auto_20241015_143022

**Session Start:** 2024-10-15T14:30:22

## [14:30:25]

Welcome everyone to today's standup. [your voice through microphone]

## [14:30:42]

Thanks for having me. I worked on the authentication system yesterday.

## [14:31:15]

[Background music from Spotify playing]
Let me share my screen and show you what I built...

## Benefits

1. **Complete Context**: Get both sides of conversations
2. **No Manual Recording**: Everything is captured automatically
3. **Searchable**: All audio transcribed and indexed in ChromaDB
4. **Unified Storage**: Same collection as screen OCR data
5. **Privacy Control**: Local processing, you control all data

## Files Updated

- ‚úÖ `audio_background_recorder.py` - Dual capture logic
- ‚úÖ `AUDIO_SETUP_GUIDE.md` - Complete setup instructions
- ‚úÖ `README.md` - Updated audio section
- ‚úÖ `start_audio_background.sh` - BlackHole detection
- ‚úÖ `AUDIO_BACKGROUND_README.md` - Updated features

## Quick Test

To verify dual capture is working:

```bash
# 1. Start the recorder
./start_audio_background.sh

# You should see:
# ‚úÖ BlackHole detected - will capture BOTH microphone AND system audio

# 2. Test microphone
say "Testing microphone capture"

# 3. Test system audio
open "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ"

# 4. Wait 60 seconds, then check:
cat refinery/data/audio/*.md
```

You should see transcripts of **both** the spoken text AND the YouTube audio!

## Cost

Transcription via OpenAI Whisper API:
- **~$0.006 per minute** of audio
- Example: 1 hour meeting = ~$0.36
- Very affordable for the value provided

## Privacy & Legal

**Important Reminders:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è You're now recording ALL audio on your computer
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Get consent before recording calls/meetings
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Check local laws about recording conversations
- ‚ö†Ô∏è All data stored locally, you have full control

## Next Steps

1. **Install BlackHole**: `brew install blackhole-2ch`
2. **Follow setup guide**: See `AUDIO_SETUP_GUIDE.md`
3. **Test the system**: Record something and check the transcripts
4. **Start using it**: Let it run in the background and search later
