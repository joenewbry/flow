# GitHub Link Fix - Summary

## Issue
The footer on all generated pages contained a broken placeholder link:
```html
<a href="https://github.com/yourusername/flow">Learn More</a>
```

This linked to `github.com/yourusername/flow` which returned a 404 error.

## Solution
Simplified the footer to remove the broken link entirely:

**Before:**
```html
<p>Generated by Flow - <a href="https://github.com/yourusername/flow">Learn More</a></p>
```

**After:**
```html
<p>Generated by Flow</p>
```

## Files Updated

### Template Files (fixed for future pages)
1. **`mcp-server/http_server.py`** - HTTP server markdown renderer
2. **`mcp-server/tools/website.py`** - Website creation tool template
3. **`website-builder/server.py`** - Static server markdown renderer  
4. **`website-builder/templates/base.html`** - Base template for HTML generation

### Documentation Files
5. **`README.md`** - Removed placeholder GitHub URLs
6. **`website-builder/static/css/styles.css`** - Added font-size to footer

## Result

✅ **All new pages** created via the MCP `create-webpage` tool will have clean footers without broken links

✅ **Server restarted** on port 8082 with the updated code

✅ **README updated** to remove placeholder repository URLs

## What About Existing HTML Pages?

The following existing HTML files in `/website-builder/pages/` still have the old footer:
- `oct-14-2025-summary.html`
- `first-flow-summary.html`  
- `ai-support-processes.html`
- `human-computer.html`
- `email-implementation-guide.html`
- `name-ideas-for-markdown-support-computer.html`

These won't update automatically since they're static HTML files. You have two options:

### Option 1: Regenerate Pages
Delete the HTML files and let them be regenerated from the `.md` files:
```bash
cd /Users/joe/dev/flow/website-builder/pages
rm *.html
# Pages will be rendered from .md files on next access
```

### Option 2: Keep Them As-Is
The pages still work fine, they just have a link that doesn't go anywhere useful. Since the `.md` files are now the source of truth and get rendered on-the-fly, the HTML files are just backups.

## Testing

Test the footer on any page:
```bash
# View a page in browser
open http://localhost:8082/page/first-flow-summary

# Check footer via curl
curl -s http://localhost:8082/page/first-flow-summary | grep -A2 "footer"
```

## Next Steps

If you want to set up a real GitHub repository:
1. Create a repository (e.g., `github.com/yourusername/flow`)
2. Update the footer to link to it
3. Update the README badges

For now, the simpler footer without the broken link is cleaner! ✨
