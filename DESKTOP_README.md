## Technical Architecture

### Main Process (`main.js`)
- Handles app lifecycle and window management
- Manages the screen tracking subprocess
- Provides IPC handlers for communication with renderer
- Implements file system operations and statistics gathering

### Renderer Process (`renderer.js`)
- Manages the user interface and user interactions
- Handles real-time updates and status monitoring
- Communicates with main process via IPC
- Provides interactive controls for the tracking system

### UI (`index.html`)
- Modern, responsive dashboard design
- Card-based layout for easy navigation
- Real-time status indicators
- Integrated logging and monitoring

## Features in Detail

### Real-time Monitoring
- **Live Statistics**: Updates every 30 seconds
- **Status Indicators**: Visual feedback for system health
- **Activity Logs**: Real-time output from tracking processes

### Process Management
- **Subprocess Control**: Start/stop tracking without closing the app
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error recovery and user feedback
- **Auto-restart**: Automatic recovery from tracking failures

### File Management
- **Quick Access**: Direct links to screenshots and analysis folders
- **File Browser**: Interactive file listing with metadata
- **Export Options**: Easy access to all captured data

### Integration Features
- **ChromaDB Integration**: Monitor vector store connectivity
- **Claude Desktop**: Configuration management tools
- **MCP Server**: Status monitoring and troubleshooting

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **App Won't Start**:
   - Check that Node.js is installed and up to date
   - Verify all dependencies are installed: `npm install`
   - Check for port conflicts (ChromaDB uses port 8000)

2. **Tracking Won't Start**:
   - Ensure you have the required permissions for screen capture
   - Check that your Anthropic API key is configured correctly
   - Verify ChromaDB is running and accessible

3. **No Statistics Showing**:
   - Make sure the screenshots and screenhistory directories exist
   - Check that the tracking system has generated some data
   - Verify file permissions for reading the data directories

4. **ChromaDB Connection Issues**:
   - Ensure ChromaDB server is running: `chroma run --host localhost --port 8000`
   - Check firewall settings for port 8000
   - Verify ChromaDB configuration in the tracking system

### Development

To contribute to the desktop app:

1. **Development Mode**:
```bash
npm run dev
```

2. **Building for Distribution**:
```bash
npm run build
```

3. **Code Structure**:
- `main.js`: Main Electron process
- `renderer.js`: Renderer process (UI logic)
- `index.html`: UI layout and styling
- `package.json`: Dependencies and build configuration

## Security Considerations

- The app requires screen capture permissions
- Network access is needed for ChromaDB connectivity
- File system access is required for screenshot storage
- API keys should be kept secure in environment variables

## Future Enhancements

- **Data Export**: Export statistics and analysis data
- **Custom Themes**: Multiple UI themes and color schemes
- **Notification System**: Desktop notifications for events
- **Plugin System**: Extensible architecture for custom features
- **Cloud Sync**: Optional cloud backup and synchronization
- **Advanced Analytics**: More detailed usage analytics and insights

This desktop application provides a complete control center for your screen tracking system, making it easy to monitor, control, and analyze your digital activity patterns.
